  "readme": "# Open Exchange Rates module for nodeJS/npm\n\n**Important update:** v0.2 is not backwards-compatible with v0.1, and the name has been changed from 'exchange-rates' to 'open-exchange-rates', to reflect the fact that it is solely a wrapper for the OXR service (the previous module had the rarely-used feature of being able to work with any other APIs, via a custom `parse` method). \n\n\n## Introduction\n\n\t$ npm install open-exchange-rates\n\nA nodeJS module that loads up-to-date currency/exchange rate data from the **[Open Exchange Rates API](http://openexchangerates.org \"Exchange Rates API, free currency conversion data\")** service, for use in your nodeJS scripts and apps.\n\nWorks perfectly with **[money.js](http://josscrowcroft.github.com/money.js \"JavaScript and NodeJS Currency Conversion Library\")** (`npm install money`) - a tiny currency-conversion library for nodeJS (and web) - but you can use the data however you like.\n\n**NB:** an App ID is required to connect to the API. It's free for personal/small-scale use and a bargain for business/commercial. Get yours in 30 seconds or less at **[openexchangerates.org/signup](https://openexchangerates.org/signup \"Exchange Rates API key signup\")**.\n\nRequires: `http-agent`\n\nTo install, type `npm install open-exchange-rates` in the terminal. Then see below.\n\n\n## Example Usage:\n\nSee the **example.js** in this repository for a basic, working usage example.\n\n#### Start with this:\n\n\tvar oxr = require('open-exchange-rates');\n\n#### Load latest rates from openexchangerates.org:\n\n\tvar oxr = require('open-exchange-rates');\n\toxr.set({ app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID' })\n\t\n\toxr.latest(function() {\n\t\t// You can now use `oxr.rates`, `oxr.base` and `oxr.timestamp`...\n\t});\n\n#### Get historical rates:\n\n\tvar oxr = require('open-exchange-rates');\n\toxr.set({ app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID' })\n\t\n\toxr.historical('2004-02-16', function() {\n\t\t// You can now use `oxr.rates`, `oxr.base` and `oxr.timestamp`...\n\t});\n\n#### Currency conversion with money.js (fx) module:\n\n\tvar oxr = require('open-exchange-rates'),\n\t\tfx = require('money');\n\t\n\toxr.set({ app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID' })\n\t\n\toxr.latest(function() {\n\t\t// Apply exchange rates and base rate to `fx` library object:\n\t\tfx.rates = oxr.rates;\n\t\tfx.base = oxr.base;\n\t\t\n\t\t// money.js is all set up now:\n\t\tfx(100).from('HKD').to('GBP'); // 8.0424 or etc.\n\t});\n\n#### Advanced API Features:\n\nThe **[Open Exchange Rates API](http://openexchangerates.org \"Open Exchange Rates - currency conversion API for developers\")** features several advanced features, for paying clients. These will be added to the module (and documented here) soon!\n\n\n## More Info\n\nFor more information, documentation, examples and showcase, check out the **[Open Exchange Rates homepage](https://openexchangerates.org \"Open Exchange Rates API - real-time currency data API\")**\n\n\n### Changelog\n\n**0.2.0** - updated to work with latest version of Open Exchange Rates API with App IDs; renamed to 'open-exchange-rates'\n\n**0.1.0** - first version\n",
